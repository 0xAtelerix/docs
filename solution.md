# Solution

Pelagos presents a multichain primitive that redefines execution, liquidity, and interoperability. 

Scaling a single dedicated Appchain for predictable, ultra-low-latency performance introduces tough architectural demands that current L1 solutions, rollups, or bridges cannot satisfy. Pelagos addresses three fundamental requirements for scalable, interoperable, and composable Web3 infrastructure:

- Cross-chain reactivity
- Consensus at Scale
- Generalized data layer

## 1. Cross-chain reactivity

### Requirement

Deliver instant, real-time response to state changes and transactions across multiple blockchains. Every millisecond matters for UX, arbitrage prevention, and throughput at scale.

### How Pelagos provides cross-chain reactivity

Pelagos achieves ultra-low-latency, bidirectional connectivity and reaction between Appchains and any external blockchains through a protocol-native sequencing layer. This data layer continuously ingests and orders transactions and state updates from diverse blockchains. The data is provided as deterministic, ordered data streams that feed directly into Appchains, enabling them to respond immediately to onchain events without requiring slow bridge confirmations or off-chain relays.

Real-time state snapshots and data frames aggregate chain state beyond mere events. This empowers developers to apply logic that dynamically analyzes and acts on complex cross-chain information (e.g., price predictions, liquidity optimization). Cryptographically enforced consensus ensures the integrity of this process, eliminating trust in intermediaries.

Furthermore, Pelagos’ native interoperability abstracts underlying chain differences, enabling bidirectional communication and action across EVM, UTXO, Solana, and other execution environments without latency-inducing translations or wrappers.

### Key features

- Trust-minimized interoperability: Cross-chain execution and liquidity are settled via cryptographic guarantees, not off-chain relayers or custodial bridges.

- Platform-agnostic execution environment: Applications can monitor, and act upon, the evolving state across EVM, UTXO, Solana, and other chains.

- Native access to live state snapshots and data frames from diverse chains, not just discrete events: Enabling predictive analytics, dynamic liquidity allocation, and real-time financial logic.

- Truly instant cross-platform response: Eliminating the inherent delays of Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) or asynchronous bridge architectures.

### Outcome

Appchains benefit from seamless, low-latency bidirectional communication with any blockchain. Your Appchain or dApp can react immediately to on-chain events including arbitrage, price movements, and governance triggers, regardless of which chain the state change originated on, unlocking true composability and capital efficiency.

## 2. Consensus at Scale

### Requirement

Consensus must remain fast, reliable, and secure—even as it scales to thousands of independent applications and high-velocity transactional loads. Bottlenecks or single points of failure are unacceptable.

### How Pelagos solves consensus at scale

Pelagos introduces a highly parallelized, leaderless Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) consensus layer combined with an Erigon-inspired, immutable database as the substrate. This parallelizes transaction ordering to maximize throughput and minimize latency. This consensus runs atop the efficient immutable database to guarantees tamper-proof, incremental state snapshots enabling rapid synchronization.

In addition to the native Proof of Stake (PoS), validators operate across multiple L1 networks using restaking, combining their stakes from Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, TON, and others to create a layered, economic security fabric. This restaking aligns incentives and mitigates the need for Appchains to bootstrap native validators or security tokens.

Data and state synchronization among validators employ BitTorrent-like peer-to-peer protocols, enabling computation-free, high-speed syncing without central coordination points.

#### Key features:

- Distributed, massively parallel consensus processing, supporting many Appchains to scale horizontally without being gated by a slow consensus engine.

- A trust-minimized protocol ensuring a robust consensus mechanism enforced by economic incentives and penalties.

- Configurable security guarantees: Restaking mechanisms that aggregate economic security from multiple L1s (Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, TON, etc.), allowing Appchains to fine-tune their own validation models and avoid security bootstrapping.

- BitTorrent-like, computation-free sync and modular validator participation, drawing direct inspiration from battle-tested approaches like Erigon's archival and sync model.

#### Outcome

Consensus is no longer the bottleneck—resources scale elastically, performance stays predictable, and Appchains can rely on robust shared security from day one. This enables complex, latency-sensitive operations such as routing trades across multiple DEXs and chains to be executed atomically within a single ~0.4 s DAG block, delivering near-instant settlement and greatly improving trading efficiency.

## 3. Generalized data layer

### Requirement

Handle complex data queries and state transitions efficiently — even at massive scale — without ballooning storage or slowing down execution when state sizes grow.

### How Pelagos provides a multichain data layer

Pelagos provides an abstract, generalized data layer that unifies cross-chain state management: abstracting underlying chain data structures into a single composable namespace. Smart contracts interact with this generalized multichain data layer as if it were a high-performance distributed database, querying and updating state atomically across chains.

Advanced indexing and incremental state snapshots optimize query latency and reduce storage overhead by loading only relevant data segments. Native data availability and verified finality guarantees ensure that smart contracts operate only on finalized, tamper-evident states.

Moreover, this design supports flexible app architectures with minimal compromise on performance or security.

#### Key features:

- A unified, protocol-agnostic state interface allowing contracts to interact with multi-chain data as if it were a single, high-performance database.

- Immutable and incremental data structures with advanced indexing, ensuring low-latency querying and minimal storage overhead.

- Native state snapshots, data availability guarantees, and instant composability for tokenomics logic, settlement, and analytics—removing the usual flexibility/performance trade-off.

#### Outcome

Appchains and dApps can query and update complex, multi-chain state in real time, enabling demanding financial, gaming, and DeFi logics to scale naturally with user growth and network activity.

By decoupling application logic from any one blockchain’s architecture and standardizing state representation, Pelagos enables developers to choose—or even mix and match—the execution environments, smart contract languages, and economic models best suited to their needs. This offers complete flexibility for Appchains to customize their architecture, including VM choice, coding language, and tokenomics.

## Why this matters

Unlike legacy solutions, Pelagos sees multiplatform execution and unified liquidity as foundational—not add-ons bolted onto legacy chains or patchwork bridges.

- It unifies execution and programmability across protocols
- It abolishes liquidity silos, allowing capital to flow freely where needed
- It supports composable application logic that transcends protocol boundaries

### Unified execution layer

Pelagos decouples the application logic from any specific blockchain runtime through a platform-agnostic execution environment, designed to interoperate across UTXO-, EVM-, Solana-style, and other execution models.

It achieves this through:

- An abstract state model: Contracts are written against a unified state interface that compiles down to protocol-specific primitives at execution time.
- Deterministic finality translation: Pelagos maps finality semantics across chains, enabling consistent behavior whether deployed on probabilistic or instant-finality chains.
- Developer simplicity: Instead of writing for a specific VM, developers can target a single framework and deploy logic that composes natively across protocols.

Outcome: Write once, transact anywhere — enabling true cross-chain logic portability and drastically reducing time to market.

### Unified liquidity fabric

Pelagos embeds a cross-chain liquidity coordination layer that routes capital and execution through a common settlement plane, eliminating the need for bridges and wrapped tokens. This allows it to natively support:

- Atomic multichain execution: Transactions can atomically span chains and dApps, with guaranteed all‑or‑nothing finality, coordinated by a trust‑minimized consensus layer to ensure correctness.
- Continuous cross-chain rebalancing and no slippage spikes: Liquidity is dynamically balanced across chains in real time, preventing bottlenecks and price impact during high demand.
- True atomic cross-chain execution: enabling high-frequency arbitrage strategies and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) with execution speeds rivaling centralized exchanges (CEXs).
- Real-time liquidations: Automated collateral sales on the deepest liquidity pools, followed by debt repayment and ledger updates, all completed in sub-seconds.

Outcome: Pelagos eliminates TVL fragmentation by enabling capital to flow natively and efficiently across chains, unlocking natural, incentive-free liquidity aggregation and maximizing capital efficiency. This creates a DeFi environment where liquidity is intelligently coordinated across chains, reducing slippage, arbitrage leakage, and trust dependencies.

### Native cross-chain composability

Beyond execution and liquidity, Pelagos enables protocol-level composability between apps on different chains — turning isolated smart contracts into networked components of a single, borderless application layer.

It achieves this through:

- Composable calls across runtimes: one contract can natively call functions in another deployed on a different chain or runtime, with state guarantees.
- Shared interfaces and schemas: standardized interaction models allow applications to plug into one another regardless of underlying architecture.
- Secure settlement coordination: transactions are resolved through a shared sequencing and verification layer that ensures deterministic outcomes across chains.
- Low latency: efficient cross-appchain communications that don't rely on Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)-like protocols.

Outcome: Pelagos delivers on the original promise of composability — not just within ecosystems but between them.

## Solution positioning

Pelagos doesn't compete with rollups or shared security ecosystems. In fact, Pelagos is more than a bridge, more than a rollup, and more than a multichain app framework. It's a shared execution and liquidity layer that solves the root cause of fragmentation in Web3 infrastructure that:

- Unifies development across heterogeneous blockchain architectures.
- Coordinates liquidity without compromising decentralization.
- Enables composability that crosses protocol boundaries.

This foundational layer unlocks a new design space for developers: permissionless, high-performance, scalable dApps that can operate across chains with the same simplicity they do within one. Furthermore, with the standard frictions that development teams face resolved, teams can benefit from fast and cheap dApp and Appchain development.

In the following section, we detail how Pelagos provides the first unified execution and liquidity primitive through its architecture, protocol mechanics, security model, and developer tools: offering developers a permissionless, high-performance, and composable platform for building the next generation of decentralized applications.
