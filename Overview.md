## Summary is last item todo but can build out for getting understanding


Pelagos is the first universal execution layer that turns every onchain pool into one seamless liquidity fabric. Developers deploy once and instantly tap deep reserves on Ethereum, Solana, BNB, Arbitrum, and beyond without bridges, wrapped tokens, and delays.

Global Liquidity Unification
* Route trades through DEXs etc., across all chains in one 0.4 s DAG block
* No TVL fragmentation or incentives required
* Continuous cross-chain rebalancing and no slippage spikes

True Atomic Cross-Chain Execution
* Ideal for high-frequency arbitrage, CEX-speed DEXs

Developer-First Experience
* Pluggable Dockerized VMs (EVM, Move, SVM, Rust) 

Permissioned & Hybrid RWA Support
* Tokenize real-world assets on private shards and settle cash legs against DeFi pools in one atomic bundle
* Real-time liquidations: sell collateral on the deepest pool, repay debt, and update ledger in sub-second
