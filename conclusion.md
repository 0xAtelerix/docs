Pelagosâ€™ architecture merges the proven efficiency of Erigon-like DAG with cutting-edge Appchain modularity. The results are fast, secure, scalable, developer-friendly deployments that remove traditional pain points from both single-chain and multichain projects. By offering deterministic sequencing, rapid scaling, robust validator security, and seamless multichain APIs, Pelagos truly advances the next generation of decentralized application infrastructure.

While several technologically sound solutions have been developed that are designed to enable the deployment of Appchains, they introduce uneasy compromises.

Individual blockchain solutions create isolated ecosystems, imposing chain-specific requirements and opposing cross-chain economic dynamics. These constraints include issues such as inflation control, limited consensus, and auction-based mechanisms tied to native tokens. 

Rollup technologies effectively address demands for high security and throughput &mdash; achieving transaction speeds up to around 1,000 TPS &mdash; however, their interoperability is often limited.

While optimistic rollups offer greater flexibility in virtual machine (VM) selection, allowing for some level of customization, the extreme length of the dispute period when exiting to back to Layer 1 (L1),
significantly hinders seamless multichain experiences.

Validity-proof-based rollups (ZK rollups) provide enhanced security but are typically tied to specific VMs, limiting flexibility. 

Both types of rollups involve trade-offs among TPS, latency, and costs, often prioritizing higher TPS and
lower costs at the expense of increased latency and decreased flexibility.

In short, none of the existing solutions truely offer a scalable, low cost, Appchain development layer that offers Ethereum-grade security.

Pelagos offers a novel solution that ensures developers can launch with:

- L1-grade security with restaking without reliance on Appchain native tokens or sidechain security models
- Custom VMs and tokenomics without requiring a full blockchain development team
- Native multichain support providing seamless, low-latency access to any L1 for both data retrieval (e.g.,
building indexes) and outbound transactions
- High TPS, low latency, and instant finality
- Scalablilty as a first-class primitive: allowing each Appchain to scale according to its own needs, rather than forcing all projects into a one-size-fits-all model

Within the Pelagos protocol, data is always available, trustworthy, and native-level for any supported blockchain &mdash; removing the need for lending trust to oracles or relying on fragile bridges.

This leaves developers free to build logic, not infrastructure: all sequencing, validator management, state sync, security, and bridging are abstracted away by Pelagos. This creates an app execution environment that is:

- Automatic, deterministic, and trust-minimized: making cross-chain automation a first-class primitive

- Scalable to any need, from single-app projects to massive, interconnected ecosystems

- Truly multichain: supporting any VM, custom logic, and real interoperability at both the data and execution levels

Pelagos lets projects focus on what matters: their application logic, products, and user experience. While the platform becomes an invisible, rock-solid foundation for composable, cross-chain web3 innovation.
