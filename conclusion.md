While several technologically sound solutions have been developed that are designed to enable the deployment of Appchains, they introduce uneasy compromises.

Individual blockchain solutions create isolated ecosystems, imposing chain-specific requirements and opposing cross-chain economic dynamics. These constraints include issues such as inflation control, limited consensus, and auction-based mechanisms tied to native tokens. 

Rollup technologies effectively address demands for high security and throughput &mdash; achieving transaction speeds up to around 1,000 TPS &mdash; however, their interoperability is often limited.

While optimistic rollups offer greater flexibility in virtual machine (VM) selection, allowing for some level of
customization, the extreme length of the dispute period when exiting to back to Layer 1 (L1),
significantly hinders seamless multichain experiences.

Validity-proof-based rollups (ZK rollups) provide enhanced security but are typically tied to specific VMs, limiting
flexibility. 

Both types of rollups involve trade-offs among TPS, latency, and costs, often prioritizing higher TPS and
lower costs at the expense of increased latency and decreased flexibility.

In short, none of the existing solutions truely offer a scalable, low cost, Appchain development layer that offers Ethereum-grade security.

Pelagos offers a novel solution that ensures developers can launch with:

- L1-grade security with restaking without reliance on Appchain native tokens or sidechain
security models
- Custom VMs and tokenomics without requiring a full
blockchain development team
- Native multichain support providing seamless, low-latency access to any L1 for both data retrieval (e.g.,
building indexes) and outbound transactions
- High TPS, low latency, and instant finality
- Scalablilty as a first-class primitive: allowing each Appchain to scale according to its own needs, rather than forcing all
projects into a one-size-fits-all model
