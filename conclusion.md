Pelagosâ€™ architecture merges the proven efficiency of Erigon-like DAG with cutting-edge Appchain modularity. The results are fast, secure, scalable, developer-friendly deployments that remove traditional pain points from both singlechain and multichain projects. By offering deterministic sequencing, rapid scaling, robust validator security, and seamless multichain APIs, Pelagos truly advances the next generation of decentralized application infrastructure.

Pelagos' novel solution ensures developers can launch with:

- L1-grade security with restaking without reliance on Appchain native tokens or sidechain security models.
- Custom VMs and tokenomics without requiring a full blockchain development team.
- Native multichain support providing seamless, low-latency access to any L1 for both data retrieval (e.g., building indexes) and outbound transactions.
- High TPS, low latency, and instant finality.
- Scalablilty as a first-class primitive: allowing each Appchain to scale according to its own needs, rather than forcing all projects into a one-size-fits-all model.

Within the Pelagos protocol, data is always available, trustworthy, and native-level for any supported blockchain &mdash; removing the need for lending trust to oracles or relying on fragile bridges.

This leaves developers free to build logic, not infrastructure: all sequencing, validator management, state sync, security, and bridging are abstracted away by Pelagos. This creates an app execution environment that is:

- Automatic, deterministic, and trust-minimized: making cross-chain automation a first-class primitive.

- Scalable to any need, from single-app projects to massive, interconnected ecosystems.

- Truly multichain: supporting any VM, custom logic, and real interoperability at both the data and execution levels.

Pelagos lets projects focus on what matters: their application logic, products, and user experience. While the platform becomes an invisible, rock-solid foundation for composable, cross-chain web3 innovation.

Welcome to the future of multichain, trust-minimized Web3.
