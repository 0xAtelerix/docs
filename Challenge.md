## Challenge

The blockchain landscape is diverse and fragmented. This fragments the underlying liquidity across the spectrum of L1s and L2s.

### Liquidity fragmentation

This silos trading and DeFi into isolated pools, creating inefficient markets, increased slippage, and the need for bridges or wrapped tokens to move assets. 

This fragmentation forces protocols to engage with external power structures such as market makers to maintain liquidity, undermining true market efficiency.

###

Complex Infrastructure for Developers: Building multi-chain applications requires deep expertise in each chain's technology stack, constructing or integrating cross-chain bridges, oracles, and relayers, and managing disparate security and settlement models. This complexity not only increases time to market and costs but also compels teams to divert energy from innovation and user experience improvements to low-level infrastructure engineering.

High Friction Cross-Chain Execution: Existing cross-chain solutions are limited to specific blockchain ecosystems, require slow and costly asset transfers, and cannot execute transactions atomically across multiple chains. Opportunities like high-frequency arbitrage, real-time rebalancing, and seamless cross-protocol trading are impossible with current solutions.

Scalability and Security Trade-offs: Traditional blockchains (monolithic Layer 1s) suffer from congestion, high gas fees, and limited execution throughput, while Layer 2s or rollups often introduce new security risks, composability challenges, and require their own networking incentives. Developers must often choose between performance, upgradeability, and integration depth, making it difficult to create scalable, high-performance apps without sacrificing security or sovereignty.

Onboarding Real-World Assets (RWA): Bringing real-world assets onchain requires permissioned execution and hybrid settlement environments. Existing platforms cannot atomically settle cash legs in DeFi pools while supporting permissioned asset management and real-time liquidation scenarios.
