# Introduction

There is an urgent need for infrastructure that enables dApps to operate, at scale and across environments as seamlessly as they do within them. We believe that the future of decentralized systems depends on a shared execution layer, unified liquidity environments, and native cross-domain composability.

Welcome to Pelagos: the first universal execution layer that turns every onchain pool into one seamless liquidity fabric. In this paper, Pelagos presents a solution that reclaims the original vision of decentralized finance (DeFi): permissionless innovation, efficient markets, and universal accessibility.

## Pelagos: Secure, scaled access to global liquidity

### Scalable multichain Appchain architecture

Pelagos’ modular architecture supports parallel sequencing, allowing the core platform and individual Appchains to be sharded for massive scalability. This lets the platform scale seamlessly to meet user demand across thousands of Appchains and up to 100,000+ TPS.

Pelagos ensures that growth doesn’t compromise network performance, security, or decentralization, empowering projects to scale fluidly as their ecosystems evolve — all within a single 0.4 s DAG block.

### Liquidity unification and atomic cross-chain settlement

Pelagos introduces a native liquidity unification layer that enables atomic settlement of transactions across multiple blockchains.

Rather than relying on traditional bridges, the protocol facilitates real-time, trust-minimized asset transfers and interactions. This capability unlocks fragmented liquidity pools, improving capital efficiency and enabling complex multichain DeFi compositions and market-making strategies.

Supporting atomic settlement, Pelagos' logic ensures transactions involving multiple chains either complete fully or not at all, eliminating partial failures and reducing counterparty risks, all while enhancing composability across the decentralized ecosystem.

## Pelagos: redefining mutichain development

Pelagos' tecnical design give teams unparalleled control over their Appchain’s scalability and liquidity — allowing them to innovate boldly while relying on Pelagos’ robust, interoperable infrastructure as the foundation of their growth.

Transforming mainnet launches into the simple acts of defining business logic, tokenomics, and project value, Pelagos handles validating, sequencing, scaling, security, and multichain APIs, supporting:

* Developer-first experiences: pluggable Dockerized VMs (EVM, Move, SVM, Rust) and choice of development language.
* Developer-controlled Appchains: launch an Appchain in the same way as a smart contract.

Development teams can deploy once; transact everywhere, for instant access to deep reserves on Ethereum, Solana, BNB, Arbitrum, and beyond — without bridges, wrapped tokens, or delays.
