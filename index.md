Welcome to Pelagos: the first universal execution layer that turns every onchain pool into one seamless liquidity fabric.

In this paper, Pelogas presents such a solution that reclaims the original vision of DeFi: permissionless innovation, efficient markets, and universal accessibility.


## Abstract

> is last item todo but can build out to verify high level understanding

Pelagos is the first universal execution layer that turns every onchain pool into one seamless liquidity fabric. Developers deploy once and instantly tap deep reserves on Ethereum, Solana, BNB, Arbitrum, and beyond without bridges, wrapped tokens, and delays.

### Pelagos: unifying global liquidity

Pelagos solves for liquidity fragmentation and offers the following innovations to dApp developers:

- Routing trades through DEXs etc., across all chains in one 0.4 s DAG block
- No TVL fragmentation or incentives required
- Continuous cross-chain rebalancing and no slippage spikes
- True atomic cross-chain execution: Ideal for high-frequency arbitrage, CEX-speed DEXs
- Developer-first experience: Pluggable Dockerized VMs (EVM, Move, SVM, Rust) 
- Real-time liquidations: sell collateral on the deepest pool, repay debt, and update ledger in sub-seconds
{a universal ledger? is this a state agreement meta?}
- Permissioned and hybrid Real-World Asset (RWA) support: Tokenize real-world assets on private shards and settle cash legs against DeFi pools in one atomic bundle
