There is an urgent need for infrastructure that enables dApps to operate, at scale and across environments as seamlessly as they do within them. The future of decentralized systems depends on shared execution layers, unified liquidity environments, and native cross-domain composability.

Welcome to Pelagos: the first universal execution layer that turns every onchain pool into one seamless liquidity fabric. In this paper, Pelogas presents a solution that reclaims the original vision of DeFi: permissionless innovation, efficient markets, and universal accessibility.

## Pelagos: Secure, scaled access to global liquidity

### Scalable multichain Appchain architecture

Pelagos' modular architecture supports separate parallel DAGs for sequencing as well as internal Appchain sharding. This allows the protocol to effectively support scaling Appchains without sacrificing performance or security across all chains in one 0.4 s DAG block.

Sharding provides performance scaling: efficiently enhancing throughput within individual Appchains, improving processing speed. Horizontal scaling enables multiple Appchains to operate mutiple DAGs concurrently - allowing consensus processing capacity to seamelesly match user demand. This architecture ensures that growth doesn’t compromise network performance or decentralization, empowering projects to scale fluidly as their ecosystems evolve.

### Customizable security with validator restaking sets

Pelagos offers a unique ability for teams to flexibly set their security postures by adjusting the proportion of their validators who restake tokens across multiple leading networks in addition to staking in the Pelagos protocol. 

This restaking mechanism intertwines the security economics of each Appchain with established, economically aligned validators from diverse ecosystems: enhancing security guarantees. Developers can determine the mix and scale of validator restaking, thereby customizing the economic incentives and security assumptions of their Appchain. 

### Liquidity unification and atomic cross-chain settlement

Pelagos introduces a native liquidity unification layer that enables atomic settlement of transactions across multiple blockchains. Pelagos makes traditional bridges obsolete by facilitating real-time, trust-minimized asset transfers and interactions across multiple blockchains.

Rather than relying on traditional bridges the protocol facilitates real-time, trust-minimized asset transfers and interactions. This capability unlocks fragmented liquidity pools, improving capital efficiency and enabling complex multichain DeFi compositions and market-making strategies. Supporting atomic settlement, Pelagos' logic ensures transactions involving multiple chains either complete fully or not at all, i.e. atomically, eliminating partial failures and reducing counterparty risks, all while enhancing composability across the decentralized ecosystem.

Together, these features give teams unparalleled control over their Appchain’s scalability, security, and liquidity &mdash; allowing them to innovate boldly while relying on Pelagos’ robust, interoperable infrastructure as the foundation of their growth.

## Pelagos: redefining mutichain development 

Pelagos transforms mainnet launches into the simple act of defining business logic, tokenomics, and project value. Validating, sequencing, scaling, security, and multichain APIs are all handled by Pelagos.

- Developer-first experience: pluggable Dockerized VMs (EVM, Move, SVM, Rust)
- Developer-controlled Appchains: launch an Appchain in the same way as  a smart contract
- Deploy once and instantly tap deep reserves on Ethereum, Solana, BNB, Arbitrum, and beyond &mdash; without bridges, wrapped tokens, or delays

> Pelagos is currently in its devnet phase, welcoming early adopters eager to explore and shape the next generation of Appchain infrastructure.
