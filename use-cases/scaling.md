# Use case: Scalable growth

Pelagos empowers Appchain teams to scale from 1,000 to 100,000+ TPS, maintaining predictable costs and dynamic control over infrastructure—even during periods of rapid growth. Developers can unlock new audiences and features without the worry of complex upgrades or cost overruns.

## The problem: Scaling costs and architectural bottlenecks

As demand grows, most scaling solutions require teams to tackle expensive architectural upgrades, deepening the technical complexity, or risk hitting bottlenecks that slow user growth and degrade experience. 

Mainstream options, whether vertically scaled L1s like Solana, Aptos, and Sui, or horizontally scaled chains like TON, fail to offer direct, seamless expansion for a dedicated Appchain. Even so-called “superchains” and L2/L3 frameworks require advanced sharding and specialist teams to keep up, limiting speed and flexibility.

Unpredictable fees, coupled with the resource intensity of upgrades and migrations, make it nearly impossible for projects to plan for growth and scale their user base in line with their ambitions. Without native horizontal scaling, developers risk either operational overload or being locked out of optimal performance. These issues are a direct outcome of the following realities.

## Limited native scaling and customization

General-purpose L1 blockchains excel at maximizing the overall transaction throughput across all network activity. However, they lack native capabilities to granularly tailor performance, execution environments, or economic models for individual Appchains. Projects discover they can’t scale horizontally, are locked into rigid consensus and architecture, and regularly face bottlenecks that spike fees or otherwise degrade the user experience. L2s and superchain frameworks, despite promising composability, often fall short when teams need custom sharding, flexible execution, or fine-grained scaling controls.

Teams are then forced into developing their own sharding models or re-structuring infrastructure—tasks that require experienced blockchain engineers and months of development.

## The solution: horizontal scaling and seamless performance boosts

Pelagos transforms Appchain scalability by combining horizontal scaling, customizable sharding, and near real-time upgrades. Projects can onboard new users, increase throughput, and deploy fresh features. This is scalable infrastructure on demand &mdash; with transparent costs and no need for specialized sharding engineers.

Each Appchain built on Pelagos determines its own scaling parameters, choosing when, and how, to introduce additional shards and execution threads. The system supports seamless sharding and microservice architectures, letting projects dynamically migrate workloads and balance resources in response to real user demand.

With Pelagos, unpredictability disappears &mdash; teams can model costs, network demands, and scaling thresholds in advance, all while keeping performance smooth and fees under control.

For example, a GameFi project experiencing rapid user growth can use Pelagos’ horizontal scaling mechanics to expand throughput instantly, prevent fees from spiraling, and maintain a seamless gaming experience. Developers scale the Appchain as needed, no waiting on labor-intensive upgrades or sacrificing user engagement.

Pelagos' native architecture sets it apart from other available scaling solutions, removing the need for specialist engineers:

- Native horizontal scaling: add or adjust shards anytime, scaling across microservices with ease.

- Custom execution environments: deploy new VMs, migrate workloads, mix and match architectures.

- Predictable costs: transparent subscriptions and scaling parameters prevent fee blowouts

- Smooth migration and upgrade paths: projects evolve with zero downtime and straightforward resource allocation.

Pelagos makes seamless, scalable Appchain growth possible &mdash; no matter how ambitious your project or dynamic your user base.
