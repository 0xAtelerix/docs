# Use Case: Unlocking Cross-Chain Liquidity

Pelagos delivers a seamless multichain layer designed for high performance and low-latency interaction across a wide range of blockchains. This capability is critical for Appchain developers and DeFi protocols that need a truly interoperable environment to thrive.

## The problem: fragmented liquidity and limited interoperability

For projects looking to grow and stay competitive, accessing large liquidity pools across multiple blockchains is essential. Unfortunately, today’s solutions come with significant drawbacks. Many multichain platforms, such as LayerZero and Axelar, are limited to EVM-compatible chains, meaning developers cannot easily reach major networks such as Bitcoin, Solana, or TON &mdash; fragmenting liquidity and constraining user access.

Adding new chains to a multiplatform Appcahin often involves complex development efforts, lengthy audits, and costly customization &mdash; slowing down expansion into new markets. Bridges introduce friction through high fees, slow withdrawals, and risks related to censorship and security vulnerabilities. 

## The solution: native multichain integration with real-time liquidity access

Pelagos addresses these challenges through native multichain connectivity. It provides direct, secure access to data and smart contracts on multiple blockchains without relying on bridges or third-party oracles. This means protocols can interact with diverse chains in real time.

Using integrated threshold signature schemes (TSS) combined with restaking of tokens from various L1 ecosystems, Pelagos enables trust-minimized, secure transaction signing. This approach decentralizes control and offers strong resilience against censorship.

Pelagos also supports reactive contracts and dynamic indexing that allow Appchains to autonomously respond to on-chain events across different blockchains. This enables sophisticated use cases like advanced treasury management, liquidity optimization, and innovative tokenomics.

Security and scalability are enterprise-grade, and customizable, leveraging diversified restaking from multiple L1s to provide a security model stronger than many standalone chains. Meanwhile, horizontal scaling can be customized to suit each Appchain’s unique needs.

### Impact and opportunities

Impact and specific examples: 

1. Aave (Decentralized Lending Protocol)

Pain: 

- Locked into EVM-only environments, limiting access to liquidity and users on non-EVM chains
- Lengthy efforts and costs required to deploy on new chains

How Pelagos solves this:

Aave is empowered to instantly access new chains like TON and Bitcoin without new deployments.

Pelagos allows Appchains to facilitate the collateralization of assets on one chain (e.g., Bitcoin) and borrow on another chain (e.g., Ethereum) seamlessly.

2. dYdX (Perpetual Trading Protocol)

Pain:

- Lost direct Ethereum liquidity after migrating to Cosmos.
- Slow and difficult cross-chain integration impacts user experience.

How Pelagos solves this:

- Restores access to Ethereum liquidity and beyond, for example to chains Solana and TON
- Provides real-time cross-chain data and instant execution, enhancing trading efficiency and liquidity depth

Protocols like Aave can instantly broaden their lending and borrowing capabilities to chains that were previously difficult to access, unlocking new liquidity without costly redeployments. While, trading platforms such as dYdX can overcome fragmented liquidity and realize near-instant cross-chain synchronization, improving execution and user experience.

Pelagos empowers projects to break free from the limitations of current rollups and single-L1 ecosystems, delivering true multichain liquidity and the agility needed for rapid market expansion.
